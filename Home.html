 <h2>Paris 2024 Olympics: Wasteful Super Falcons surrender to Female Samba of Brazil</h2>
 <p>The Super Falcons began their Paris 2024 Olympics campaign with a shaky start on Thursday, losing to Brazil’s superior firepower in their opening Group C match.
 Under the guidance of Randy Waldrum, the Nigerian side was wasteful and inexperienced in the first half, allowing the more seasoned Brazilian team to take advantage with a 1-0 lead by halftime. 
The 39-year-old Brazilian captain, Marta, played a pivotal role in the Falcons' painful defeat at the Matmut Atlantique in Bordeaux, France. Her involvement led to Brazil’s narrow 1-0 victory in the first match of the Paris Olympics.</p>

<h3>Esteban Ocon Joins Haas for 2025 F1 Season</h3>
<p>French driver Esteban Ocon is set to make history as the first Formula One Grand Prix winner to join Haas after signing a multi-year contract starting next season. The US-owned team announced the news on Thursday, confirming that Ocon will team up with British rookie and Ferrari reserve Oliver Bearman in a completely new driver lineup. Ocon will be leaving Renault-owned Alpine, who had previously disclosed his departure.
Haas, which entered Formula One in 2016 and has yet to secure a race victory, will benefit from Ocon's experience. The French driver achieved his only career win to date with Alpine at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix. Throughout his career, Ocon has raced in 146 Grand Prix events and has previously driven for the now-defunct Manor and Force India teams.</p>

<h4>Chelsea has initiated disciplinary proceedings against midfielder Enzo Fernandez following his posting of a video that the French Football Federation (FFF) described as containing an alleged "racist and discriminatory" chant. The FFF announced on Tuesday that it would be filing a complaint with FIFA regarding the video, which features a song sung by members of the Argentina squad about French players.
Fernandez's teammate, Wesley Fofana, who has one cap for France, shared an image of the video on Instagram, labeling it as "uninhibited racism." In response, Fernandez expressed deep regret for his actions, apologizing for the video posted during Argentina's Copa America celebrations. He acknowledged the offensive nature of the song and emphasized that the words used do not reflect his beliefs or character.</h4>
